# Site Blocker - A Privacy-Focused Website Blocker

**Site Blocker** is a minimalist, privacy-first browser extension that helps you block distracting or unwanted websites without giving up control over your data.

Most site blockers promise productivity but quietly track your browsing behavior or inject third-party scripts. Site Blocker does **none** of that. It’s open-source, lightweight, and designed to respect your privacy. No telemetry, no analytics, no cloud sync **everything stays on your device**.

## 🌐 Supported Browsers

Site Blocker works on all Chromium-based browsers, including:
- Brave 
- Chrome   
- Edge  
- Vivaldi
- Opera

It’s especially well-suited for privacy-oriented browsers like **Brave** or **Vivaldi**, where user control and minimal tracking are core principles.

## 🔐 Why Site Blocker?

Most popular extensions:
- Collect and sell browsing data
- Inject tracking or cookie scripts
- Require unnecessary permissions

**Site Blocker is different:**
- 🔒 100% local - nothing leaves your browser
- ⚙️ Full manual control - you choose which domains to block
- 🧠 Distraction-free - improve focus and digital well-being
- 📦 Lightweight - no bloat, no background services
- 🛡️ Zero tracking - no cookie banners triggered, ever
